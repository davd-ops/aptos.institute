## Overview

A gamified learning approach unlocks huge improvements to student's motivation to learn. Rather than dropping someone into a huge pool of resources and letting them drown in them, we can redefine the landscape and present only resources relevant to their next assignement. Rather then forcing them to come up with topics they want to learn about, we present them with options relevant to their progress path.

With each completed course, users get score and tokens, influenced by their number of attempts and any hints they used. That score can be improved later by repeating the same course.

Tokens are awarded based on score improvement and are fully on-chain. That allows any third party to integrate our internal currency and seamlessly build on top of Aptos Institute. Accumulated tokens can be burned to unlock more advanced courses on user's path tree, or "bump up" user's profile, making it more visible to hiring companies.

On-chain resume is a soulbound NFT representation of skills someone has acquired through Aptos Institute and can be used as proof-of-skill when looking for a job.

Our courses and materials are tailored to Aptos Ecosystem, combining jargon-free information with interactive coding experience which let's you write, compile and test your code in browser.

## The Future

Aptos Institute aims to expand beyond coding courses to include topics like Wallets, DeFi, Gas and other areas that are hard to grasp for beginners. Making it a hub for Aptos newbies whether they are devs or users.

As an open-source public good project, we also aim to crowd-source materials from individuals or groups from everywhere in a world. This also allows for decentralized fact-checking and maintenance of existing materials. Think of this as your teacher having hundreds or thousands of brains instead of one!

## Closing thoughts And Demo

Developers are incentivized to go through a gamified hands-on curriculum, Companies benefit from hiring talent with verifiable, on-chain resumes, and the Aptos Ecosystem thrives!
